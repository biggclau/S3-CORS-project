    "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. With CORS support, you can build rich client-side web applications with Amazon S3 and selectively allow cross-origin access to your Amazon S3 resources.\n",
    "This project will show you how to enable CORS using the Amazon S3 console to enable a website hosted on an ec2 instance to make call to fetch data from an S3 static website.\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure your bucket to allow cross-origin requests, you add a CORS configuration to the bucket. A CORS configuration is a document that defines rules that identify the origins that you will allow to access your bucket, the operations (HTTP methods) supported for each origin, and other operation-specific information. \n",

    "SCENARIO 1\n",

Make sure your ec2 instance have a role attached to it that has AmazonS3FullAccess and AmazonSSMFullAccess policies attached to it. Note that thsi instance must be able to serve traffic from the internet since it will be used to host a public facing website.\n",
